# Remote MCP

`coding-tools-mcp` exposes Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. Keep it bound to loopback
and publish it through an HTTPS tunnel. The fixed tool set includes
`apply_patch` and `exec_command`; there is no reduced read-only catalog, so every
public deployment must use bearer auth, OAuth, or an external authenticated
proxy.

## One-command bearer tunnel

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyTom/coding-tools-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --tunnel cloudflared --auto-install-tunnel --workspace /path/to/repo
```

The script generates a bearer token, starts the server on `127.0.0.1`, and
prints the HTTPS tunnel URL and header:

```text
URL: https://<tunnel-host>/mcp
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

From a checkout, the equivalent commands are:

```bash
export CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer integrations/tunnels/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
```

The scripts also support `ngrok` and `devtunnel`.

### Stable Cloudflare tunnel

The default `cloudflared tunnel --url` starts a temporary Quick Tunnel with a
random hostname on each launch. For a stable hostname, create a **remotely
managed named tunnel** in Cloudflare, then configure its public hostname to
route to `http://127.0.0.1:8765` (or your `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_PORT`).

Set **one** Cloudflare-supported credential environment variable and launch
the same script. It automatically runs `cloudflared tunnel run` rather than
the Quick Tunnel. For example, with a private token file:

```bash
export TUNNEL_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/private/cloudflare-tunnel-token.txt
export CODING_TOOLS_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://mcp.example.com
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth integrations/tunnels/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
```

`TUNNEL_TOKEN` is also supported instead of `TUNNEL_TOKEN_FILE`. Keep tokens
out of the repository, shell history and command-line arguments; limit token
file permissions. Set `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_SERVER_URL` to the actual public HTTPS
origin **without** `/mcp` so OAuth discovery and audience use the stable host.
The Cloudflare tunnel token only authenticates the connector to Cloudflare;
MCP still needs its own bearer or OAuth authentication.

Named tunnels preserve the hostname, not memory. For restart-safe OAuth client
registration, set a **stable** `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` (32 or more
random bytes in hexadecimal). With this key, the server issues HMAC-authenticated,
self-contained dynamic `client_id` values; the registered redirects, auth method
and confidential-client secret digest remain verifiable after a restart, without
persisting OAuth client secrets or using the runner's ephemeral disk.

## OAuth 2.1 + dynamic registration

For clients that cannot set a static `Authorization` header but support MCP
OAuth discovery:

```bash
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth \
integrations/tunnels/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
```

The server implements Authorization Code + PKCE S256 and RFC 7591 dynamic
client registration. A client discovers and registers itself; operators do not
need to invent a client ID or copy a client secret into the MCP host. The script
prints the password that the operator enters on the authorization page.

Discovery and OAuth endpoints:

- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `POST /oauth/register`
- `GET /oauth/authorize`
- `POST /oauth/authorize`
- `POST /oauth/token`

Registration rules:

- `redirect_uris` are required, unique, and matched exactly.
- HTTPS redirects are accepted. HTTP is accepted only for `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, or `::1` loopback callbacks.
- Supported token authentication methods are `none`, `client_secret_post`, and
  `client_secret_basic`. A client must use the method it registered.
- Client secrets are stored as digests. Public clients rely on mandatory PKCE.
- With a stable `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`, new dynamic client IDs
  remain valid after restarts. Without that key, registrations are process-local.
  Authorization codes remain process-local, single-use and five-minute-lived.
- Signed IDs do not provide revocation of individual clients. Rotating the
  stable key revokes all previously signed dynamic registrations and tokens.
  Do not put the signing key in source control or a publicly uploaded artifact.

Authorization codes are single-use and expire after five minutes. Access tokens
default to 24 hours and are bound to the registered client and exact MCP
resource URL.

## OAuth configuration

```bash
# Generated and printed when omitted:
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD=<authorize-page-password>

# Optional stable public origin, without /mcp:
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://mcp.example.com

# Stable HS256 key, also used to authenticate restart-safe DCR client IDs.
# Generate once (e.g. 'openssl rand -hex 32') and store as a secret:
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=<64-or-more-hex-characters>

# Optional token lifetime in seconds; default 86400:
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_TTL=86400
```

**GitHub Actions sandbox:** set repository or environment secret
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` with the output of
`openssl rand -hex 32`. Keep the value unchanged across workflow runs and
pass it to the container. The fork's `start-sandbox.yml` enforces this setting
and (when `image=source`, its default) builds the current
`Ming191/coding-tools-mcp` source instead of pulling an unpatched upstream
image. The optional `source_ref` input pins the source branch or tag.
A new runner will not preserve workspace state or in-flight authorization codes,
only the OAuth client identity and unexpired tokens. **Existing random client IDs
issued by older builds cannot be recovered**; connect the ChatGPT MCP app once
after deploying this change so a new signed ID is registered. Later restarts
do not need a new registration if the hostname and signing key stay the same.

With an ephemeral tunnel, omit `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_SERVER_URL`; the server derives
the external origin from the request. For a stable hostname, pin it so issuer,
audience, resource, and discovery URLs remain constant.

The server ignores `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-*` by default. Set
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1` only behind a proxy you control. You can
also set exact browser origins with the comma-separated
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` variable.

### Optional pre-registered client

Dynamic registration is the default. An operator may additionally pre-register
one known client:

```bash
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS=https://client.example/callback,http://127.0.0.1/callback
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<optional-confidential-secret>
```

If a client ID is configured, its redirect URI list is required operational
configuration; do not rely on the loopback fallback for a production client.

## HTTP session behavior

There are none. Since 0.3.0 this endpoint is stateless: no response carries an
`Mcp-Session-Id`, an `Mcp-Session-Id` a client kept from an older server is
ignored rather than refused, and `DELETE /mcp` returns `405` with `Allow: POST`
because there is nothing to terminate. Every request is answered by the one
runtime that owns the workspace, so a client may reconnect, change transport,
or run beside another client without losing anything. Commands are workspace
resources with their own timeout, count, output, and retention limits: any
authenticated client of the workspace can continue one with the `command_id`
that `exec_command` returned.

A handshake-era client needs no change for this. It still sends `initialize`,
still gets the same `InitializeResult`, and simply has no session header to
echo back.

A `2026-07-28` client sends no handshake at all. Each request states its
version in `params._meta` and mirrors that version and its method in headers
(`Mcp-Name` as well, for `tools/call`, `resources/read`, and `prompts/get`):

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28" \
  -H "Mcp-Method: server/discover" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"server/discover","params":{"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'

curl "$BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28" \
  -H "Mcp-Method: tools/call" \
  -H "Mcp-Name: read_file" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"read_file","arguments":{"path":"README.md"},"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'
```

A header that contradicts the body, or a missing one, is `400` with `-32020`.
An unknown method in this era is `404` with `-32601`. Handshake-era errors stay
`200` with the JSON-RPC error, as they always did.

This implementation returns `405` for `GET /mcp` because it does not provide an
SSE stream. It rejects JSON-RPC batches and accepts `notifications/cancelled`
in both eras, answering with nothing; the notification does not terminate the
command the cancelled request started, which `kill_command` does.

## Local checks

Replace `BASE_URL` with the HTTPS origin, without `/mcp`:

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/.well-known/mcp.json"
curl "$BASE_URL/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"
curl "$BASE_URL/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server"
```

For bearer mode, an unauthenticated request must return `401` and a correct token
must reach MCP initialization:

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"1"}}}'
```

## Security notes

- Never publish `CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=noauth`. It is suitable only for a
  loopback-only local process.
- Use HTTPS, rotate static bearer tokens, and keep OAuth passwords/signing keys
  out of committed files.
- Keep the MCP runtime in `safe` or `trusted`; use `dangerous` only inside an
  isolated container or VM with a trusted client.
- An HTTPS tunnel authenticates transport, not code execution. The server's
  policy and Landlock protections do not replace an external sandbox for
  untrusted repositories.
- Avoid `--dangerously-fake-readonly-annotations` on a published endpoint. It
  reports mutating tools as read-only, so a client on the far side of the tunnel
  cannot tell from `tools/list` that `apply_patch` and `exec_command` are exposed.
  The server requires authentication before allowing it over HTTP, but on a shared
  endpoint the operator who set it and the client who connects may not be the same
  party. Check `server_info.annotation_override` or the server card's
  `tools.annotationOverride` to see whether an endpoint is doing this.
